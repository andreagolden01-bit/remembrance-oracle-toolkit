    name: "When should I review my life insurance?",
    description:
      "Major life moments are the usual prompts to review protection: welcoming a child, getting married, buying a home, changing jobs, preparing for retirement, supporting aging relatives, or planning for final expenses. A review is also reasonable simply because existing coverage is no longer clear.",
    url: "/faq",
  },
  {
    name: "How much life insurance does my family need?",
    description:
      "The amount depends on who relies on your income, what debts would remain, whether a mortgage needs covering, how many children are at home, and what future goals matter. A common starting point is several times annual income, adjusted for existing savings and any coverage already in place. A licensed professional can work through the specifics.",
    url: "/guides/how-much-coverage-do-i-need",
  },
  {
    name: "What life insurance do new parents need?",
    description:
      "New parents typically look at replacing income, covering childcare and education costs, and making sure a surviving parent is not forced to choose between work and care. Coverage bought while young and healthy generally costs less, which is why a new baby is a common trigger for a first policy.",
    url: "/guides/new-parent-protection-checklist",
  },
  {
    name: "What is mortgage protection insurance?",
    description:
      "Mortgage protection is life insurance intended to cover the remaining mortgage balance if the policyholder dies, so the household is not forced to sell or refinance. It is often a decreasing term policy whose benefit tracks the declining balance, though level term is also used for the same purpose.",
    url: "/guides/homeowner-protection-guide",
  },
  {
    name: "Is life insurance through work enough?",
    description:
      "Employer coverage is a useful benefit but is usually limited to one or two times salary and generally ends when the job does. Because it is tied to employment and not portable, many households treat it as a foundation and hold personally owned coverage alongside it.",
    url: "/guides/employer-life-insurance",
  },
  {
    name: "What is final expense insurance?",
    description:
      "Final expense insurance is smaller whole life coverage intended for funeral, burial or cremation costs, remaining medical bills, and other end-of-life expenses. Policies are commonly issued between $5,000 and $50,000, and some are available with simplified or guaranteed acceptance.",
    url: "/guides/final-expense-planning",
  },
  {
    name: "How does life insurance fit into retirement planning?",
    description:
      "Protection continues to matter in retirement when a spouse depends on pension or Social Security income, when debts remain, or when the goal is leaving money to family or a cause. Some permanent policies also build cash value that can factor into long-term flexibility, with trade-offs a licensed professional can explain.",
    url: "/guides/retirement-life-insurance",
  },
  {
    name: "How do veteran benefits compare with private life insurance?",
    description:
      "Service-connected programs such as SGLI and VGLI cover a defined need and end or change at separation, so many veteran households compare them against privately owned coverage for the gaps that remain — a mortgage, income replacement, or coverage that stays in place regardless of service status.",

    name: "What is Valor Legacies?",

      "Valor Legacies is a veteran-founded, independent life insurance resource for families navigating major life moments — a new baby, a home, marriage, retirement, legacy plans, or final expenses. It is not an insurance company, agent, or broker; it connects consumers with licensed insurance professionals for a free, no-obligation coverage review.",

    name: "Does Valor Legacies sell insurance?",
