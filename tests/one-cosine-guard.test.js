/**
 * one-cosine-guard.test.js — nothing outside decoder-stack.js may carry
 * its own depth-flow.
 *
 * ECOSYSTEM §7 says one decoder, one cosine. That was a rule with no
 * enforcement, and the same defect landed three separate times:
 *
 *   1. decoder-stack.flowCosines itself had CHECK = [29,58,87,116] with
 *      Math.min(116, …) baked in, written when four layers existed and
 *      never lifted when four more activated. Fixed by deriving the
 *      checkpoints from the active layers.
 *   2. coherency-mapper.js kept destructuring that call to [d1,d2,d3,d4]
 *      and hardcoding Math.min(116, …) in coherencyFlow, so every macro
 *      map decided duplicates, orphans and bridges on 116 of 232 dims.
 *   3. defect-resonance.js carried a PRIVATE _flow with
 *      CHECK = [29,58,87,116,145], so the self-teaching channel signed
 *      and matched at 145-D while canonical was 232-D.
 *
 * Each was found by reading, months apart. A copy cannot follow the
 * stack when a layer activates — that is the whole failure mode — so the
 * rule has to be mechanical.
 *
 * The check is deliberately narrow: hardcoded checkpoint ladders, width
 * caps at a known composed boundary, and fixed-arity destructuring of a
 * flow. Comments are stripped first, because the modules above now
 * DESCRIBE these mistakes in prose and describing one is not committing
 * one.
 *
 * fractal-index.js is exempt by design, not by convenience: its
 * searchFlow deliberately reads each pattern at its OWN real depth to
 * remove mixed-depth bias, computing boundaries from LAYER_DIM and
 * MAX_DEPTH rather than a written-down ladder. It follows the stack.
