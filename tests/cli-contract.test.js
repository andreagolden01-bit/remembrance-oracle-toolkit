/**
 * The CLI layer's contracts.
 *
 * Coverage measured 2026-08-10 put every command module between 3% and 17%
 * line coverage while core sat at 85–100% — and the bugs were exactly where
 * the coverage wasn't. `oracle audit` answered a bare invocation with
 * "Unknown audit subcommand: null. Run `oracle audit` for help.", naming the
 * command that had just produced the error, because no help branch existed.
 * Nothing failed, because nothing looked.
 *
 * These tests encode the two invariants those defects broke. They drive the
 * real CLI as a subprocess (the path a user actually takes) and the real
 * registration (the path the handlers actually take), so neither can be
 * satisfied by a mock.
