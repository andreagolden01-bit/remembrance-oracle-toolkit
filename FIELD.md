# The Remembrance Field — Operational Reference

The canonical, verifiable, falsifiable description of what is wired
into the LivingRemembranceEngine (LRE) field, what it measures, and
how to confirm the data on your own machine.

This document is the **compass**: for every concept the project
claims, it names the file, the function, the source key, the
contract that pins it down, and the on-disk evidence you can read.
It is intentionally terse and data-first — every claim either points
to a file:line or names a falsifiable test number.

For *why* the architecture is shaped this way, read
[`ECOSYSTEM.md`](./ECOSYSTEM.md) §5 and [`MANIFESTO.md`](./MANIFESTO.md).
For first-time AI onboarding read [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md).

## 1. What the field is

A single persistent scalar state with a per-producer histogram,
written to one file per host:

```
.remembrance/entropy.json     ← canonical (hub) location
```

Schema (verified by Void contract **C-45**, `Void-Data-Compressor/verify_capabilities.py`):

```json
{
  "coherence":     <number>,   // ∈ [0, 0.999] — Void contract C-56
  "globalEntropy": <number>,   // cost / (coherence + ε)
  "cascadeFactor": <number>,   // ∈ [0, 5.0]   — Void contract C-55
  "updateCount":   <integer>,  // monotonic
  "timestamp":     <ms epoch>,
  "sources": {
    "<source key>": { "count": <int>, "lastCoherence": <number>, "lastTimestamp": <ms> },
    ...
  }
}
```

Three implementations of the same engine, kept in lockstep:

| Language | File | Cap enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| JS  | `src/core/living-remembrance.js`        | `Math.max(0, Math.min(0.999, …))` (line 138) |
| Python | `Void-Data-Compressor/living_remembrance.py` | Same clamp, asserted by C-47 |
| TS | `core/living-remembrance-engine.ts`     | `Math.min(0.999, …)` (constructor + update) |

Drift between implementations is a covenant violation. Caught by:
- **C-47** (LRE math invariant `globalEntropy = cost/(coherence+ε)` holds)
- **C-49** (all JS LRE callers resolve to one canonical entropy.json)
- **C-56** (`contribute()` math caps coherence at 0.999)
- **C-55** (`contribute()` math caps cascadeFactor at 5.0)

---

## 2. The update rule

`contribute({ cost, coherence, source })` advances state via:

```
p           = clamp01(coherence ?? state.coherence)
r_eff       = r₀ · (1 + α · (1 − p)⁴)                  // retro-causal pull
δ_void      = δ₀ · (1 − p)                              // free coherence donation
γ_cascade   = exp(β · state.cascadeFactor)              // collective acceleration
newC        = clamp(0, 0.999, p + r_eff·0.1 + δ_void·0.15)
newEntropy  = cost / (newC + ε)
newCascade  = min(5.0, state.cascadeFactor + 0.05 · newC)
```

With defaults `r₀ = 0.05, α = 15.0, δ₀ = 0.03, β = 8.0, ε = 1e-8`.

The cascade saturates at 5.0 by design — the cap is a **safety
governor**, not a measurement limit. Once saturated, additional
contributions still update coherence and the source histogram; the
cascade simply stops amplifying. This is intentional: a runaway
positive-feedback loop in the field would spill the ecosystem.

---

## 3. Producers wired into the field

The compass: every producer of a numeric signal contributes. The
table below is the canonical list; the source-histogram keys map
1:1 to files in `src/`. Empirical counts at end of this session
are shown for orientation.

### 3.1 Direct contributors (call `contribute()` themselves)

| Source key | Where it fires (file:line) | Cost | Coherence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reflection-scorer:<dim>` | `src/core/reflection-scorers.js:642` | 1 | dim score |
| `covenant` | `src/core/covenant.js` (inside check) | 1 | sealed ? coh : 0 |
| `reflect` | `src/reflector/engine.js` | 1 | reflection result |
| `audit` | `src/audit/*` | 1 | finding severity inverse |
| `lint`, `smell`, `harvest` | `src/audit/*`, `src/evolution/*` | 1 | quality score |
| `risk-score` | `src/quality/risk-score.js` | 1 | inverse risk |
| `reflector:*` | many under `src/reflector/` | varies | varies |
| `swarm:*` | `src/swarm/*` | 1 | consensus value |
| `oracle:*` | `src/api/*` and `src/core/*` | 1 | varies |
| `void:coherency_v3` | `Void-Data-Compressor/coherency_v3.py` | 1 | unified score |
| `void:resonance_detector` | `Void-Data-Compressor/resonance_detector.py` | scan size | mean off-diag |
| `void:ecosystem_health` | `Void-Data-Compressor/ecosystem_health.py` | novelty promotions | base health |
| `void:rag_query` | `Void-Data-Compressor/rag_query.py` | hits | mean hit-coherency |

### 3.1b The store, through the equation (2026-09-05)

The 45,547-pattern canonical store carries no compressor reading (its rows
are 232-D lens vectors; the compressor cannot read a lens vector as bytes),
so it had never entered the field. It enters through the field's own
definition of coherence for a vector — the master equation's first line,
`p = |⟨Ψ_healed | Ψ⟩|²`, implemented by `computeCoherence()` once
`loadHealedAnchor()` has been given the attractor:

| Source key | Where it fires | Cost | Coherence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `attractor:<anchor-id>:<source_stem>` | `scripts/field-from-store.js` (one contribution per store row) | 1 | `computeCoherence(row)` = squared overlap with Ψ_healed |

The anchor is **sovereign** — the owner's to choose. Default: the fifteen
covenant principles as `src/core/covenant-principles.js` states them,
unfolded through the one decoder (232-D at the active depth); its id
(`covenant-15-<sha8>`) is in every source key, so a change of anchor is a
visible change of what "healed" means. `--anchor <file>` overrides.
Measured with the default anchor: p spans 0.1323 … 0.3921 over the 45,547
rows, 2,129 distinct values at 4dp. **Not** a compressor reading and never
labelled `void:*`; the histogram's compressor census stays honest.

### 3.1c Durable witnesses the field restores from

`field-memory.restoreLatest()` reads every durable witness and loads the
one with the most history: the newest `field-snapshot` pattern, the live
and committed ledgers' latest `_entropy`, the committed seed, and — new —
the recovery coin's data plane (`REMEMBRANCE-BLOCKCHAIN/data/data-plane/
field.json.gz`, trusted only when its sha256 matches the coin body).

### 3.2 Trigger contributors (this session's wirings)

These were dead-config before this session — defined constants and
docstring promises with no implementation. Each is now wired and
contributes:

| Source key | Trigger | Cost | Coherence | Test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `quantum:cascade-spawn:<table>` | pattern amplitude crosses `CASCADE_THRESHOLD = 0.70` on successful feedback | 1 | newAmplitude | `tests/quantum-field.test.js` "Cascade trigger" |
| `quantum:decoherence-sweep` | end of `decoherenceSweep()` summarising amplitude decay | rows touched | avg post-sweep amplitude | `tests/quantum-field.test.js` |
| `quantum:phase-drift-sweep` | end of `decoherenceSweep()` if any phase advanced via `PHASE_DRIFT_RATE = 0.01 rad/day` | rows drifted | avg amplitude | `tests/quantum-field.test.js` |
| `validator:domain:<domain>` | `validateCode({ domain })` with any of 13 domains | 1 | coherency if valid, 0 if rejected | `tests/validator-domain-floor.test.js` |
| `validator:domain-floor-ratchet:<domain>` | floor ratcheted threshold upward (security domain at 0.65 vs caller's 0.60) | (floor − threshold) × 10, min 0.5 | same as above | `tests/validator-domain-floor.test.js` |

### 3.3 Event bridge (every `_emit` lands)

`src/core/event-field-bridge.js` subscribes to `oracle.on(...)` and
routes every emitted event to the field. Known event types map to
calibrated coherence signals; unknown types are skipped (no
mislabeling).

| Source key | Emit site | Coherence signal (default) |
|---|---|---|
| `event:pattern_registered` | submit success | `payload.coherency ?? 0.85` |
| `event:auto_promote` | lifecycle promotion | `payload.coherency ?? 0.9` |
| `event:auto_heal` | healing succeeded | `payload.newCoherency ?? 0.8` |
| `event:auto_heal_failed` | healing failed | `0.1` |
| `event:auto_grow` | autoGrow expansion | `0.7` |
| `event:cascade_spawn` | recycler spawn from cascade | `payload.newAmplitude ?? 0.75` |
| `event:compound_growth` | `_tryCompound` fired | `0.75` |
| `event:decoherence_sweep` | sweep finished | `payload.avgAmplitude ?? 0.4` |
| `event:deep_clean` | cleanup pass | `0.65` |
| `event:entangled` | `entangle()` linked two patterns | `0.85` |
| `event:entry_added` | new entry persisted | `payload.coherency ?? 0.7` |
| `event:feedback` | user feedback recorded | `payload.newReliability ?? 0.7` |
| `event:field_reexcited` | decohered patterns boosted | `payload.avgAmplitude ?? 0.7` |
| `event:harvest_complete` | crawler harvest pass | `payload.coherency ?? 0.8` |
| `event:healing_complete` | healing run finished | `payload.coherency ?? 0.85` |
| `event:import_complete` | bulk import finished | `payload.successRate ?? 0.7` |
| `event:pattern_evolved` | pattern evolution stored | `payload.newCoherency ?? 0.85` |
| `event:regressions_detected` | regression sweep | `0.2` |
| `event:rejection_captured` | submit rejected | `0.15` |
| `event:resolve_served` | resolve request answered | `payload.coherency ?? 0.7` |
| `event:rollback` | rollback applied | `0.3` |
| `event:similarity_candidate` | similarity gate match | `payload.similarity ?? 0.6` |
| `event:stale_detected` | stale pattern flagged | `0.4` |
| `event:vote` | vote cast | `payload.weight ?? 1.0` (`approve === false` → `0`) |
| `event:auto_submit_complete` | auto-submit pipeline finished | `payload.coherency ?? 0.65` |

The full table is encoded in `_coherenceFor()` in
`src/core/event-field-bridge.js` and pinned by 11 unit tests in
`tests/event-field-bridge.test.js`. The cost extractor `_costFor()`
pulls batch hints (`count`, `spawned`, `totalDecohered`, `reexcited`,
`harvested`, `cleaned`, `imported`) so a batch event contributes
weighted, not as a single tick.

## 4. Empirical verification

To prove the field works on your machine, run:

```bash
# 1. Run any operation that emits — full hub test suite is fine
npm test

# 2. Read the field state
node -e "console.log(JSON.stringify(require('./src/core/field-coupling').peekField(), null, 2))" \
  | head -50

# 3. Run the Void contracts that pin the invariants
cd ../Void-Data-Compressor && python3 verify_capabilities.py --strict
```

After step 1 the source histogram will contain:
- All 5 `reflection-scorer:<dim>` keys (per-dimension contributions)
- The 5 trigger keys from §3.2
- The 13+ `event:*` keys from §3.3
- All `void:*` keys from any Void-side runs
- `covenant`, `reflect`, `audit`, `lint`, `smell`, `harvest`, etc.

`coherence` will be ≤ 0.999 exactly (Void C-56).
`cascadeFactor` will be ≤ 5.0 (Void C-55).
`updateCount` will be monotonic across all subsequent runs.

---

## 5. Why this is the compass

A non-coder reader can answer four questions by reading the field
alone — no source code needed:

1. **What's wired?** Every source key in `sources` corresponds to
   one wired producer. Sorted alphabetically, the histogram is a
   live list of the system's active participants.
2. **What's failing?** Sources with consistently low `lastCoherence`
   (rejections, failures, regressions) sit alongside successes —
   the field shows both.
3. **What's saturated?** When `cascadeFactor = 5.0`, the field is
   under high collective load. The cap holds the ecosystem from
   spilling.
4. **What's missing?** Anything documented in this file that does
   NOT appear in the histogram after a representative run is a
   broken wiring — file a bug.

This is the empirical handle on a project whose framing draws from
information theory, quantum measurement, and remembrance covenant.
The framing is documented in `MANIFESTO.md` and `ECOSYSTEM.md`.
The data is here.

---

## 6. Covenant for AI participants

Working in this repo means accepting the engineering covenant. The
constraints are falsifiable, not negotiable:

- **One canonical encoder** — `src/core/code-to-waveform.codeToWaveform`. No parallel implementations (Void C-53).
- **One canonical field file** — `.remembrance/entropy.json` at the hub. No local-only field shards (Void C-49).
- **Coherence ≤ 0.999, cascade ≤ 5.0** — every implementation clamps (C-55, C-56).
- **Every producer contributes** — if a module emits a numeric judgement, it routes through `field-coupling.contribute()`.
- **No side artifacts where the substrate can hold the data** — new patterns go into the SQLite store, not standalone JSON files.
- **Every emit lands in the field** — via the event-field bridge (§3.3).
- **No new dead constants** — anything imported from `constants/thresholds.js` or `quantum/quantum-core.js` must be read. If it's not, either wire it or delete it.

The broader covenant — about unity, remembrance, and the worldview
that motivated the architecture — is documented in `MANIFESTO.md`.
The engineering invariants here ARE the math expression of that
worldview, not a separable layer above it. Any code running in this
substrate is bound by the math whether the writer shares the
worldview or not. The data is the contract.

---

## 7. What this enables

Once any pattern-bearing input is encoded into the substrate, the
following problem classes reduce to `encode → contribute → read`:

| Problem class | Operation in the field |
|---|---|
| Anomaly detection | new pattern's coherency vs field median |
| Behavioral prediction | sequence encoded, field's response is the forecast |
| Cross-domain correlation | encode A in domain X, B in domain Y, cosine compare |
| Drift analysis | per-source `lastCoherence` over time |
| Trust calibration | contributor's submitted patterns vs canonical field |
| Ecosystem health | global `coherence`, `cascadeFactor`, `globalEntropy` |
| Pattern discovery | clusters in the field that emerge without being looked for |

The hard part is no longer the calculation. It is the **selection of
data** and the **interpretation of the result**.

---

## 8. How the system teaches you

There is no separate onboarding. Every submission goes through:

1. `codeToWaveform` encodes (Void contracts **C-51**, **C-53**)
2. `covenantCheck` runs (sealed or rejected)
3. `computeCoherencyScore` measures
4. `getDomainFloor(domain)` ratchets the threshold (security non-negotiable)
5. `validateCode` returns valid / rejected with the specific reason
6. `contribute()` lands the result in the field
7. The source histogram now shows your contribution

If the submission violates the math, the response names the contract
that broke. If it passes, it appears in the histogram. The covenant
is enforced by execution, not by documentation. Read this file to
understand what is happening; you do not need to read it to be
correctly bound by it.

---

## 9. Field memory — compression + recall

`src/core/field-memory.js` makes the field remember itself. Every
observation that enters the field is also compressed and offered to
the pattern library; the field's whole state is periodically
snapshotted into the same library; and the field can recall its own
history.

### 9.1 Compression of every observation

On every `contribute()`, `field-memory.recordObservation()`:

1. Serializes the observation (`source` + coherence bucketed to 2dp).
2. Encodes it via the canonical `codeToWaveform` → 256-D waveform.
3. Runs the **similarity gate**: cosine (via canonical `waveformCosine`)
   against every `field-event` pattern already in the library.
4. If the nearest match is ≥ `NOVELTY_THRESHOLD` (0.97), the shape is
   already known — **dropped by design**. Only genuinely new shapes
   are stored.

Stored field-events are patterns in the unified library:
`language = 'field'`, `patternType = 'field-event'`,
`tags = ['field-event', 'compressed']`, with the 256-D waveform and
its FNV-1a digest in `coherencyScore`.

This is the compressor doing its job: "store what's new, drop the
rest." A run that fires thousands of contributes adds only a handful
of patterns — the count of *distinct observation shapes*, not events.

### 9.2 Snapshots — the field's history

`field-memory.snapshot()` encodes the **entire source histogram** into
one waveform and stores it as a `field-snapshot` pattern. Taken
automatically every `SNAPSHOT_EVERY` (500) contributes and once on
process exit. Similarity-gated against prior snapshots, so a snapshot
identical to the last is dropped.

The library therefore accumulates a temporal record of the field's
shape over its whole lifetime.

### 9.3 Recall — the meta-awareness query

`field-memory.recall(fieldState)` encodes the current field state and
cosine-compares it against every stored snapshot:

```js
const { recall } = require('./src/core/field-memory');
const { peekField } = require('./src/core/field-coupling');
recall(peekField());
// → { familiar: true, similarity: 0.9999, nearestId: '...', snapshotCount: 4 }
```

`familiar: true` means the field has been in a configuration this
close before. This is the substrate for meta-awareness — the field
knows its own history and can recognize when it returns to a
previously-seen state.

### 9.4 The blockchain path

Solana-anchored history feeds in through the **same** door:
`recordObservation({ source: 'solana:<...>', coherence, cost })`.
Blockchain observations are compressed, similarity-gated, and stored
identically to local observations. When the chain feed is live, the
field's memory will include the anchored ledger automatically — no
separate ingestion path.

Everything in field-memory is best-effort: if the canonical store
can't be opened, every function no-ops and the field still works.

---

## 10. The mesh — everything compressed against everything

The library is not a pile of data — it is a basis set. Every
observation is compressed *against the entire existing library*, so
the information lives in the N×N relational mesh, not the N points.
A modest, fully-cross-referenced library outperforms a huge
uncross-referenced pile: you need coverage, not volume, and coverage
saturates fast (a run of thousands of contributes adds only a handful
of patterns once the basis spans the space).

### 10.1 Persisted cross-reference

When `recordObservation()` or `snapshot()` stores a pattern, it also
computes that pattern's **top-5 nearest neighbors** (id + similarity)
and persists them in `coherencyScore.neighbors`. This is the mesh
edge, recorded as-of-insertion — the pattern's neighborhood at the
moment it entered the field. Immutable, like every field record.

### 10.2 The mesh-query API — "call the field, filter for your domain"

```js
const fm = require('./src/core/field-memory');

// What is this input most like?
fm.neighbors('field-event\nsource: covenant\ncoherence: 0.99', { k: 5 });
// → [{ id, kind, similarity }, ...] ranked descending

// The whole region of the mesh near a point
fm.within(someInput, { threshold: 0.97 });
// → every field pattern within 0.97 cosine

// The Library-of-Alexandria call — query, retrieve, filter by domain
fm.query('healing covenant security work', { k: 10, tag: 'field-event' });
// → [{ id, name, patternType, tags, similarity }, ...] ranked
```

`neighbors()` and `within()` compute live against the in-memory
waveform cache (O(distinct shapes), microseconds). `query()` searches
the full field library and supports `patternType` / `tag` filters —
the retrieval interface: call the field, filter for whatever your
domain is, get back the relevant compressed patterns ranked by
similarity.

The persisted edges (10.1) are the historical record — each pattern's
world at birth. The live queries (10.2) are current truth — the mesh
as it stands now. The field philosophy throughout: record the moment,
compute the present.
