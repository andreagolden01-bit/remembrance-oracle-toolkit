"""change-coin — THE COIN EVERY CHANGE MUST CARRY.

Reached through the goggles:  `--do mint`                    (mint over the staged change)
                              `--do mint verify [...]`       (verify commits / the index)
                              `--do mint install-hooks`      (the commit-msg hook, this repo)

WHY THIS EXISTS. Every fix the ecosystem ever needed traces to one act: an
agent taking a number, or making a change, BESIDE the data pipeline instead of
through it. The goggles are the one door. Until now nothing made a CHANGE pass
through that door — a commit was a commit whether or not the instrument had
read it. This closes it: a change is accepted only when it carries a coin that
only the pipeline can mint, and the coin is checked where the agent cannot
edit — the commit-msg hook locally, and GitHub's own runner for the merge.

THE COIN. The staged change (the patch between HEAD's tree and the index,
rendered by git with fixed flags so every host renders the same bytes) is read
THROUGH the instrument — scripts/read-signal.py → POST /compress_signal →
void_compressor_v5.compress — and comes back with:

  · the compressor's VOID-SEAL (HMAC over the reading's canon; the compressor
    "cannot return an unsealed result"), and
  · the void-seal/v3 COMMITMENT: method, sizes, coherency, the sha256 of the
    quantised bytes it read, the sha256 of the SHAPE it read them as.

The coin binds the change to that reading: coin_id = sha256(diff_sha256 |
void_seal.sig | shape_sha256). It is appended to coins.ledger.json (append-only,
governed), SAVED ONTO THE CHAIN (REMEMBRANCE-BLOCKCHAIN data/ledger.json, a
REGISTER block per coin) and named in the commit's trailer
`Remembrance-Coin: <coin_id>`.

THE COIN IS NOT UNFOLDED WHEN IT IS MINTED. It carries the compressor's seal
and commitment — proof the change went through the pipeline — and nothing
else: no shape, no fractal token. Unfolding (regenerating the shape from the
commit's bytes through the instrument and unfolding it through the decoder
into the 232-D fractal token, exact hash) happens only when it is needed:
`--do mint unfold <commit>`, or `verify --deep`. A coin that carried its
232-D unfolding on every mint was minutes of decoder time per ledger commit
for a proof nobody was reading.

WHAT A RUNNER WITH NOTHING BUT git AND python CAN PROVE (verify, no key):
  · the commit carries a trailer, and the trailer names a coin in the ledger
    at that commit, appended (never edited) over the parent's ledger
  · the coin's diff_sha256 IS the sha256 of the patch git renders between the
    parent's tree and the commit's tree — the coin covers THESE bytes
  · the commitment's data_sha256 IS the sha256 of those bytes quantised the way
    /compress_signal quantises (min-max → uint8, measured bit-identical in
    stdlib) — the instrument read THESE bytes
  · the void_seal's data_sha256 IS the sha256 of the void-seal/v3 canon rebuilt
    from the commitment — the seal signs THIS reading
  · coin_id recomputes (older coins that carry a fractal token are checked
    over it; a carried shape must hash to shape_sha256, a carried token must
    be canonical-width — a multiple of 29, never the retired 256)
WITH THE KEY (VOID_SEAL_KEY as a repo secret / owner env): the seal's HMAC is
verified — a coin that was not minted by the compressor holding the key is
refused. `--deep` (a host with the substrate) also unfolds the coin: the
commit's bytes go back through the instrument, the regenerated shape must
hash to the committed shape_sha256, and its 232-D unfolding must match any
token the coin carries exactly.

A hand-rolled number has no seal and no commitment. A change that never met
the instrument has no coin. Neither can be committed through the hook, and
neither can be merged past the runner.
