/**
 * detached substrate read of the URL being fetched. Never blocks, never denies.
 *
 * goggles-web-hook — PASSIVE web reading. This is the piece that makes the
 * goggles read/compress/score data *while you browse* rather than on demand.
 *
 * Why PreToolUse and not PostToolUse: WebFetch's result is a model-summarized
 * answer, not the raw bytes — scoring that would measure the summary, not the
 * data. PreToolUse hands us the URL from tool_input, so we fetch the ORIGINAL
 * bytes ourselves and read those through the substrate.
 *
 * Detached by construction: a substrate read takes ~10-20s (compressor init),
 * and a hook that blocks browsing for 20s is a hook that gets uninstalled.
 * Output lands in .remembrance/web-readings.jsonl; the field gets the
 * contribution under source goggles:web:<host>.
