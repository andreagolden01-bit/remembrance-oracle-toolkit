/**
 * trap-learner.js — the trap ledger grows from mistakes as they are made.
 *
 * THE OPERATOR'S RULE (2026-09-12): the ledger of mistakes is the instrument's
 * learning, and it must grow on its own from the mistakes an agent makes, not
 * wait for someone to write them up. Three sources feed it, all of them
 * things the instrument itself observed:
 *
 *   1. THE WALL. Every denial the bash hook issues is a mistake the wall
 *      caught (goggles-denials.jsonl). One denial is a slip; the same rule
 *      hit REPEAT_TO_TRAP times on a host is a pattern, and a candidate trap
 *      is written from the wall's own words (the rule it refused under, the
 *      command shape, the verb it named).
 *   2. THE INSTRUMENT'S TELLS. A reading that carries a tell the trap ledger
 *      already names — a resonance reading where the threshold never said no,
 *      a served fit far below the search — is recorded by the surface that
 *      saw it (`--do traps learn <json>`), with the numbers.
 *   3. THE AGENT'S OWN ACCOUNT. When an agent records a mistake it made
 *      (`--do traps learn <json>` with wrong/truth/tell/correct), it lands as
 *      a candidate with full weight.
 *
 * Candidates live in .remembrance/traps.json — the local learned store brief.js
 * reads and `--do traps promote` appends into the seed (traps-ledger-ratchet).
 * `--do mint` in the hub promotes every candidate that has earned it and syncs
 * the mirrors, so a round that minted a coin also grew the ledger. Promotion
 * is append-only and anchored on the chain like every other seed entry.
 *
 * Keyed the way brief.js and the ratchet key traps: by the first 120 chars of
 * `wrong`. A candidate seen again raises its count; it never duplicates.
