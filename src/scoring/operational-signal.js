/**
 * operational-signal.js — operational coherency as a field signal.
 *
 * The field has historically heard from SCORING events (compute coherency,
 * scan safety, verify execution, score resonance). The diagnostic surfaced
 * a structural gap: the field is blind to OPERATIONAL events — requests
 * served, queries run, writes committed. Every infrastructure module
 * (server, store, MCP handlers, submission gateway) performs work the
 * field could observe through one shaped signal: latency + success.
 *
 * This module gives operational events a coherency-shaped reading that
 * plugs into the same field-coupling.contribute() pipeline as the scoring
 * signals. It's the new axis the diagnostic asked for: the field grows
 * a per-source histogram of OPERATIONAL health alongside its scoring one.
 *
 * Signal shape:
 *
 *   latencyCoherence(durationMs, expectedMs)
 *     Returns expectedMs / (expectedMs + durationMs). Natural [0,1] mapping:
 *       duration = 0       -> 1.0  (instant)
 *       duration = expected -> 0.5  (on budget)
 *       duration = 10×expected -> 0.09 (heavily over)
 *     Smooth, monotonic, no thresholds, no clamping needed.
 *
 *   operationCoherence({ durationMs, expectedMs, ok })
 *     Failed operations contribute coherence 0 regardless of speed (an
 *     operation that errored is not a coherent operation). Successful
 *     ones get their latencyCoherence reading.
 *
 *   recordOperation({ source, durationMs, expectedMs, ok, cost })
 *     Computes the operation's coherence and contributes to the field.
 *     Source MUST start with 'op:' so operational tracks are easy to
 *     filter from scoring tracks in the per-source histogram. Best-
 *     effort; never throws.
 *
 *   withOperationalTracking(source, expectedMs, asyncFn)
 *     Wraps an async function so every call records its operational
 *     coherency automatically. Returns the wrapped function — drop-in
 *     replacement for hot paths.
