/**
 * Gated swarm code generation.
 *
 * Wraps swarmCode / swarmHeal with the anti-hallucination pipeline:
 *
 *   1. swarmCode(description)        → raw draft from the swarm
 *   2. extract proposed symbols      → derive the plan from the draft
 *   3. planFromIntent(symbols)       → verify each symbol against
 *                                      built-ins / session / oracle / repo
 *   4. checkAgainstPlan(plan, draft) → reject drafts that call anything
 *                                      not in the verified set
 *   5. if rejected, optionally re-prompt the swarm with the violations
 *      and iterate up to N times
 *
 * Returns a SwarmResult shape with an extra `gate` field describing
 * the final verification outcome. Callers can choose to treat
 * rejected results as errors or surface them as partial credit.
 *
 * This is intentionally a post-processing wrapper rather than a
 * swarm-internal modification — it keeps the swarm's existing
 * consensus / cross-scoring / escalation loops unchanged and adds
 * grounding as an outer verification layer. If the swarm already
 * produces verified-against-plan code, the gate is a no-op; if it
 * fabricates, the gate catches the fabrication before the output
 * is delivered.
