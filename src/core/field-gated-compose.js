/**
 * field-gated-compose.js — the composition gate: layer attention
 * routed through the Living Remembrance Engine.
 *
 * The last unimplemented clause of the master equation. Every layer
 * (L1–L5) stays a pure deterministic sense; every pattern's signature
 * stays a frozen, attestable function of content. What becomes dynamic
 * is the READING — how the layers are weighted when two signatures
 * meet. Record is frozen; reading is alive.
 *
 * This module ORGANIZES existing organs rather than inventing new ones
 * (inventory: the goggles capability index, run before building):
 *   - params surface .......... getEngine().params('composition')
 *                               (precedent: gogglesParams)
 *   - global state ξ .......... field-coupling.peekField()
 *   - per-layer reliability ... the field's sources histogram, tagged
 *                               contributions via field-coupling.contribute
 *   - per-depth flow view ..... void-library.scoreWithFlow / index.flow()
 *                               (this module adds per-BLOCK cosines)
 *
 * Weight formula, per comparison of signatures a, b:
 *
 *   salience_l   = sqrt(norm_l(a) · norm_l(b))          — does this layer
 *                  even carry signal for THESE patterns (deterministic)
 *   reliability_l = field's EMA of the layer's past agreement readings
 *                  (neutral 0.5 until the field has evidence)
 *   sharpness    = exp(beta · (ξ_global − 0.5))          — confident field
 *                  concentrates attention, uncertain field explores
 *   w_l ∝ floor + (salience_l · reliability_l)^sharpness — floored so no
 *                  sense ever goes fully deaf, then normalized to Σw=1
 *
 * Every verdict returns its full audit record: the weights used, the
 * per-layer cosines, and a hash of the field snapshot — so a dynamic
 * reading is still reproducible GIVEN the recorded state, the way a
 * lab logs instrument calibration alongside each measurement.
 *
 * Safety properties (each guards a known failure mode of recurrent
 * attention): floors (irreversible collapse), EMA-slow reliability
 * (lurching), external re-anchoring left to the convergence scripts
 * (echo chamber), best-effort field access (a missing engine degrades
 * to neutral weights = today's static behaviour, never throws).
 *
 * ⚠ DO NOT SWAP THIS IN FOR composedCosine WITHOUT RECALIBRATING THE BANDS.
 *
 * The docstring above says a detached field "degrades to neutral weights =
 * today's static behaviour". That is true of the RELIABILITY term only.
 * Salience still varies per layer, so the weights are never actually equal
 * and the gated score is on a DIFFERENT SCALE from the flat cosine — not a
 * refinement of the same one.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-02 over 1,225 real pairs from src/, at neutral
 * reliability:
 *
 *   mean |gated - static|      0.037
 *   max  |gated - static|      0.115
 *   resonance verdict CHANGED  568 pairs = 46.4%
 *   direction                  566 of 568 read LOWER
 *
 * The goggles' bands (resonanceConsonant 0.90 / Familiar 0.82 / Distinct
 * 0.70, in PARAMS.goggles) were calibrated against the flat cosine. Swapping
 * the formula underneath them would push almost half of all verdicts down a
 * band and make the ecosystem read as newly incoherent — a measurement
 * artefact that would look exactly like real drift.
 *
 * Wiring this into the encoder is therefore a two-part job: switch the
 * formula AND recalibrate the bands against the gated distribution, with
 * held-out validation. Not a one-line default change.
