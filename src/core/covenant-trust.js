/**
 * covenant-trust.js — the covenant's trust-classification layer.
 *
 * Scanners (security patterns, harm patterns, command-injection detector,
 * etc.) consult this module BEFORE flagging. The covenant decides what is
 * statically trusted; scanners don't carry their own exemption lists.
 *
 * Two ideas:
 *
 *   1. TRUSTED SOURCES — expressions whose VALUE is statically resolvable
 *      and cannot be user-controlled. Passing one to a shell sink is not
 *      command injection, no matter what regex says. Examples:
 *        process.execPath       — Node's own binary path
 *        process.argv0          — Node's own argv[0]
 *        __dirname / __filename — Node's resolved module paths
 *        path.join(__dirname, …) when args are literals or trusted
 *      The default set ships with Node's hardcoded globals. Operators
 *      extend it via `addTrustedSource(name)`.
 *
 *   2. ROLE-ANNOTATED FILES — files that DEFINE patterns rather than
 *      EXECUTE behavior. A file containing the literal fragments
 *      'SEL'+'ECT' to build a detector regex is not itself a SQL
 *      injection. The annotation `@oracle-pattern-definitions` in the
 *      file header marks it as a definitions file; scanners should
 *      classify its findings differently (or skip the self-detection
 *      classes that would otherwise self-match).
 *
 * Learning hook: `recordFalsePositive(snippet, reason)` records a labeled
 * FP and (in this minimal first pass) augments the in-memory trusted-
 * source registry if the snippet contains a clear trusted expression.
 * Persistence is delegated to the caller in this version (write the
 * registry to disk if you want it to survive restarts) — a deeper learning
 * loop with disk persistence is a follow-up.
 *
 * Every scanner reaches one place when it wants to know "is this trusted?"
 * — the covenant. Nothing is "exempt" from the covenant; the covenant just
 * has a richer vocabulary now.

 * Field-validated covenant growth via two-oracle consensus. The covenant

 *              raise (or at least maintain, within ε) the global field
 *              coherency? Run via projectContribution.
 *
 *   Oracle B — the signal-validity oracle: does the pattern's contribution
 *              shape look like natural measurement against the rolling
 *              baseline? Run via validateContribution.
 *
 * The two oracles fire independently and are pitted against each other.
 * Four possible outcomes:
 *
 *   A=yes, B=yes  → ABSORB. Both oracles agree the pattern earns its place.
 *   A=no,  B=no   → REJECT. Both oracles agree the pattern doesn't belong.
 *   A=yes, B=no   → QUARANTINE (shape-suspect). The pattern would raise
 *                   coherence but its signal-shape is inconsistent with
 *                   natural measurement — the sophisticated-injection class:
 *                   it gamed the value check but couldn't fake natural
 *                   distribution. Held, not absorbed.
 *   A=no,  B=yes  → QUARANTINE (low-value-real). The shape looks natural
 *                   but the value would drag the field down. A real but
 *                   low-quality observation. Held, not absorbed.
 *
 * Patterns only enter the kingdom when independent oracles, looking at
 * different aspects of the same candidate, both say yes. This is the
 * falsification engine applied to the absorption step: the truth-layer
 * principle from the README enforced at the gate.

 * Batch absorption via two-oracle consensus at batch granularity.
 *
 * Where maybeAbsorbPattern judges one pattern at a time (and the
 * signal-validity oracle is mostly a value sanity check at n=1), this
 * judges a batch *as a unit*. The variance signature of the batch is
 * the real B-oracle signal: a batch of patterns with natural
 * distributional spread looks like real measurement; a batch with
 * narrow-band shape against a healthy baseline does not, and the
 * substrate flags it as the sophisticated-injection class.
 *
 * Atomicity: the batch is the decision unit. Both oracles agreeing
 * absorbs every valid pattern in the batch. Either rejecting holds
 * every pattern. There is no per-pattern split inside a batch — if
 * you want per-pattern decisions, call maybeAbsorbPattern in a loop.
 *
 * Oracle A (coherency, green-light): would absorbing this batch raise
 *   or at least maintain the global field coherency? Modelled as one
 *   heavy contribution at the batch mean with cost = batch size. This
 *   is conservative — the engine integrates contributions one at a
 *   time so the true impact depends on order, but the mean-with-cost
 *   projection is the right summary for a batch decision.
 *
 * Oracle B (signal-validity): does the batch's variance signature
 *   match natural measurement? The H3 finding is direct: narrow-band
 *   contributions displaced from the rolling baseline collapse global
 *   coherence in a characteristic way. validateContribution names
 *   that shape directly.
 *
 * Four outcomes, identical to maybeAbsorbPattern:
 *
 *   both-accept  → absorb every valid pattern in the batch
 *   both-reject  → hold every pattern
 *   A-yes-B-no   → hold (shape-suspect class — adversarial signature)
 *   A-no-B-yes   → hold (low-value-real class — natural but harmful)
