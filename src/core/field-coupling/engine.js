/**
 * Field-coupling helper for the LivingRemembranceEngine.
 *
 * Every producer of a numeric score (reflect, audit, risk-score,
 * covenant, security-scan, etc.) calls `contribute()` here after
 * emitting its result. The helper is best-effort: if the engine
 * can't be loaded (e.g. running in a stripped environment), it
 * no-ops silently so production callers don't break.
 *
 * Backpressure-by-field (per the design principle):
 *   The LRE's own dynamics throttle implicitly — when many producers
 *   contribute rapidly, cascadeFactor and globalEntropy saturate,
 *   making further contributions less impactful and signaling to
 *   high-volume callers that the field is hot. Callers can peek via
 *   `peekField()` and self-throttle (delay/batch) when entropy
 *   exceeds a threshold. There is no hardcoded rate limit; capacity
 *   is added by adding nodes, not by raising a knob.
