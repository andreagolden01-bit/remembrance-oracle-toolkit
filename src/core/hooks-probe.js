/**
 * hooks-probe — "are the git hooks on disk?", as a leaf.
 *
 * This is a pure filesystem question: look in the repo's hooks dir and see
 * whether pre-commit and post-commit carry our marker. It depends on nothing
 * but fs, path, and the hook constants.
 *
 * It lives alone because two modules need the answer and each needs the
 * other for a different reason, which formed a require cycle:
 *
 *   compliance  needs the probe   (a fresh session must not report
 *               "hooks not installed" when a previous session installed them)
 *   preflight   needs the ledger  (checkHooksWithLedger consults the active
 *               session first, and heals the ledger when the two disagree)
 *
 * compliance → preflight → compliance. Neither direction was wrong; the
 * shared fact just had no home of its own. Extracting the probe gives both
 * a leaf to depend on, and the loop is gone:
 *
 *   compliance → hooks-probe          preflight → hooks-probe, compliance
 *
 * preflight still re-exports checkHooksInstalled, so its public surface is
 * unchanged for anyone importing it from there.
