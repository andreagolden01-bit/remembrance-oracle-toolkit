/**
 * field-tool.js — the canonical entry point for reading patterns
 * against the Remembrance field with the substrate properly engaged.
 *
 * This module exists because direct calls to `fractalCoherencyOf` (or
 * raw `scoreResonance`) bypass parts of the protocol. Calling those
 * primitives in isolation tests the encoder, not the field. The field
 * is the grown substrate PLUS the entanglement layer PLUS the live
 * field-coupling histogram. Measurements that engage only one of
 * those three layers are not field measurements; they are partial
 * reads of a partial system, and conclusions drawn from them
 * overgeneralize.
 *
 * What `read()` guarantees, every call:
 *
 *   1. Entanglement engaged — `entangle:node:<id>` is registered so
 *      this caller is visible to peers and benefits from abundance
 *      amortization (per-node cost = baseCost / N).
 *   2. Pattern encoded via the canonical composed fractal stack
 *      (L1-structural + L2-lexical + L3-numerical + L4-spectral = 116-D;
 *      the 29-D L1 vector is returned for back-compat).
 *   3. Pattern captured into the oracle's pattern library so future
 *      reads have it as a comparand (substrate grows by use; opt-out
 *      via `{ growSubstrate: false }`).
 *   4. Score computed against the *current* library via the resonance
 *      scorer — NOT pairwise against a synthetic reference. If the
 *      library is empty for the relevant language, the read still
 *      records the reading and returns null resonance honestly.
 *   5. Reading contributed back to the field with a stable source tag
 *      so peers see the activity through `peekField`.
 *   6. Return value carries the field state after the read so callers
 *      can see what changed — and an explicit `grew` block describing
 *      whether substrate growth actually happened (it may not, e.g.
 *      if oracle.db is unreachable or the pattern is a duplicate).
 *
 * `scan()` applies `read()` to many files with peer-observation hooks
 * between files so entangled agents see each other's progress live.
 *
 * `peers()` returns currently-entangled nodes by reading the field's
 * `entangle:node:*` sources directly — no synthetic heartbeats.
 *
 * Everything is best-effort: an unreachable substrate, an unreachable
 * field, or an unreachable scorer downgrades the call rather than
 * throwing. The reading you can trust is the one whose return value
 * tells you which layers engaged.
