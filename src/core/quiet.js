/**
 * quiet — the canonical home for best-effort failures.
 *
 * A `catch (e) {}` that does nothing is not error handling; it is a
 * failure vanishing without a trace. The plain-engineering audit found
 * 462 of them in src/. Many are legitimately best-effort — a field write
 * that must never break its caller — but "best-effort" and "invisible"
 * are not the same thing. This module makes the difference: a swallowed
 * failure still swallows (control flow is unchanged), but it is COUNTED
 * per site and, under ORACLE_DEBUG, spoken. Silence becomes a
 * measurement instead of an absence.
 *
 *   try { risky(); } catch (e) { quiet('module:where', e); }
 *
 * Read the tally any time with quietFailures() — a diagnostic surface,
 * the readable side of the counter, exactly like the admin organs'
 * covenant-status debug view.
 *
 * This is a pure leaf: it requires nothing from the codebase (stdlib
 * only), so it can be required from anywhere without tangling the graph,
 * and its debug output goes to process.stderr directly — not through
 * console.* — so it adds nothing to the print surface the console
 * ratchet governs.
