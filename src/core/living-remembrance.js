 * `engine.contribute({ cost, coherence })` after their main work.
 * The current state is readable any time via `engine.getState()` and
 * is what the witness chain attaches to each block's metadata.
 *
 * ONE RESONANCE SPACE (2026-09-07). p(t) was an overlap of RAW composed
 * vectors — the cone, where every row reads ≈0.9 against anything (trap 49),
 * so 25k attractor readings in the histogram were readings of the cone. The
 * anchor and every row now pass through resonance-space.js (the whitened
 * reference; 256-D refused as NaN); healedSpace() names the space. The seal
 * gate and the measured void term below were never reached by any caller —
 * field-coupling dropped both at the door; it carries them now.
