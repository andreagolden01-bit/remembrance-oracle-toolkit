/**
 * covenant-entangled — the two covenant gates, crossed, in one leaf module.
 *
 * A file can be judged by two INDEPENDENT scanners:
 *   - the fractal audit (covenant-fractal.js): byte-scale ungated
 *     mutations + atomic-scale missing periodic-table declarations.
 *   - the covenant scanner (covenant.js, principle 11): SQL / injection /
 *     harm at the source level.
 * They read DIFFERENT things. A file can pass one and be blocked by the
 * other — quantum-field.js reached fractal-clean after annotation while
 * its `${table}` DDL interpolations still broke the covenant scanner
 * (trap 27). Judging an exemption sheddable from one gate alone is how
 * that slips through.
 *
 * fullCovenantAudit runs BOTH and reports `clean` only when the fractal
 * audit is healthy AND the covenant seals — neither verdict is complete
 * for a shed decision without the other, so they are always crossed here.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE LEAF MODULE: entangling the two meant one gate module
 * requiring the other, which grew the lexical require knot (the cycle
 * ratchet caught it, 62→64). This module sits ABOVE both gates as a pure
 * consumer — nothing in core requires it back — so the coupling lives in
 * one leaf instead of tangling the two cores together. The load graph
 * stays acyclic and the lexical baseline holds.
