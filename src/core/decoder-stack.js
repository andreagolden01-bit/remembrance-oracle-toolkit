/**
 * decoder-stack.js — registry + depth-aware composer for the
 * fractal-by-stacking encoder layers.
 *
 * Per the architectural principle: the encoder isn't a fixed
 * function; it's a stack that grows as the substrate finds residual
 * that current layers don't explain.
 *
 *   depth 1 (L1):  structural fractal   29-D
 *   depth 4:       +L2 lexical +L3 numerical +L4 spectral → 116-D  (composed_v1, legacy parity anchor)
 *   depth 7:       +L5 redundancy +L6 content +L7 dimensional → 203-D  (composed_v4, live)
 *   depth 8:       +L8 dynamical → 232-D  (active stack; MAX_DEPTH)
 *   L9 relational, L10 alignment: registered, INACTIVE (validated, not yet earned).
 *   (These are LENS axes, not the compressed payload — see the disclaimer below.)
 *
 * Each layer encoder is registered with a `seed`: the kind of
 * residual it was designed to explain. The residual monitor (in
 * residual-monitor.js) measures whether activated layers are
 * sufficient, and signals when the stack should grow.
 *
 * Entanglement with the Void compression flow: compression invokes
 * the stack at currentDepth(); if compression finds collisions
 * (residual signal), the stack activates the next registered layer.
 * Encoder spawning is part of compression, not a separate process.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * DISCLAIMER — what the composed dimensionality IS (and is NOT):
 * The composed vector's dimension (29-D per layer; 203-D `composed_v4`
 * live, up to 232-D at MAX_DEPTH=8; 116-D `composed_v1` is only the
 * legacy parity anchor) is the number of structural AXES the lenses
 * separate the data into — the coordinate frame in which the
 * compression is EXTRACTED as a mathematical equation (pattern +
 * residual). It is NOT the compressed payload and it is NOT a lossy
 * fingerprint. The Void compression itself (see void_compressor_v5.py)
 * is LOSSLESS: it stores `pattern_reference + residual` and
 * reconstructs the exact original bytes (verified byte-for-byte, always
 * ≤ zlib). Do not read this dimension as "the compression" or as a
 * compression ratio — it is the lens frame the equation is written in.

The four-telescope experiment localized the missing signal: the gzip-NCD (compression) telescope sees domain/content structure the structural stack does not (kNN domain purity: stack 0.60 vs gzip 0.83). L6 imports that view by PATTERN PROJECTION onto a fixed compression basis — each coordinate is 1-NCD against a canonical landmark pattern, mean-centered so the discriminating relative profile is the signal. CALIBRATED, not asserted: scripts/encoder-layer-calibration.cjs confirms L6 moves the fractal telescope toward the gzip telescope — Spearman 0.778 → ~0.81 and kNN purity 0.60 → 0.71 with FIXED landmarks, closing over half the structure-to-compression gap.

CODE PATH MIGRATED: both FractalIndex copies are MAX_DEPTH=7, the flow scorer\'s deepest score (d4) now consumes every active layer at the shared whole-block depth, the published field-tool package is byte-identical at depth 7, and the export round-trip carries 203-D — all inert on legacy 116-D vectors (they compare at their shared depth) so nothing regresses.

The telescope-2d experiment confirmed this axis is real and independent of gzip (Spearman 0.34, purity 0.67 vs chance 0.15). L7 imports it, SELF-GATED on intrinsic dimensionality: it parses a numeric series out of the text (the substrate stores series as text — the 2D structure is in the VALUES, not the digit bytes), detects the period by autocorrelation (as L4 does), reshapes to a PERIOD-MATCHED grid (a fixed sqrt-width misses arbitrary-period structure — a sine of period 44 gives gain 0 at width 20, gain 0.24 at width 44), and emits a 2D-NCD projection onto numeric archetypes SCALED BY THE 2D-GAIN.

Both look random to a compressor; the difference is that chaos is PREDICTABLE in delay-coordinate (Takens) space and true randomness is not. L7 catches 2D structure but is PERIOD-GATED, so it is blind to chaos, whose determinism lives in an aperiodic return map (x_{t+1} = f(x_t)). L8 imports the established dynamical-systems instruments: Bandt-Pompe permutation entropy, MPR statistical complexity (Rosso et al. 2007 "Distinguishing noise from chaos" — the complexity-entropy plane), and delay-embedding nearest-neighbour predictability (the core determinism signal).

 * This is the canonical flow reading — the mapper's pairwise pass, the

 * a local copy (one decoder, one cosine — ECOSYSTEM §7).
 *
 * WHY THIS CHANGED — it used to read only 116 of 232 dimensions.
 *
 * The body was `CHECK = [29, 58, 87, 116]` with `n = Math.min(116, …)`, a
 * hard cap written when four layers existed. Four more were built and
 * activated since — L5-redundancy, L6-content-projection, L7-dimensional,
 * L8-dynamical — and the cap was never lifted, so every resonance reading in
 * the ecosystem discarded half the decoder's output. The layers ran, emitted
 * their 29 dims each, and were truncated at the comparison. currentDepth()
 * reported 8 and Void's pattern store held 232-D vectors (C-02), while the
 * function that compares them stopped at 116.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHANGES — honestly, including the costs:
 *
 *  1. Every flow reading now spans all 232 dims. Numbers move. A pair whose
 *     surface structure matched but whose redundancy or content-projection
 *     differs will read LOWER than before, and that is the point: the layers
 *     that separate look-alikes were the ones being cut.
 *  2. The return array is now 8 long, not 4. Consumers that indexed [3] as
 *     "the deepest" must use the LAST element. `deepestFlow()` is exported
 *     for exactly that, so no caller hardcodes an index again.
 *  3. Stored readings taken before this change are not comparable to
 *     readings after it — they measured a different width. Same boundary
 *     problem as the coherency rewiring; treat pre-change flow numbers as a
 *     different quantity rather than differencing across it.
 *  4. Cost is ~2x per comparison: the sweep touches 232 dims instead of 116.
 *
 * Vectors shorter than a checkpoint reuse the deepest reading available, so
 * a 116-D legacy entry still returns a full-length array — its later
 * checkpoints simply repeat, which is visible rather than silent.
