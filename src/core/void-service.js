/**
 * void-service.js — the one way to ask the Void compressor for a coherency.
 *
 * There is exactly one producer of coherency in this ecosystem: the Void
 * compressor. This module is the single client for it, so that "ask the
 * instrument" is implemented once rather than once per caller.
 *
 * It exists because it was already implemented twice. scripts/goggle-web.js
 * knew how to start the service and wait for it; the reader added to
 * field-tool.js did not, and simply gave up when the service was cold. Same
 * job, two behaviours, and the weaker one sat on the hottest read path — the
 * same class of drift the one-encoder rule (Void C-53) exists to prevent.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - Reads the artifact's OWN BYTES as a uint8 waveform, quantised the way
 *     goggle-web.js quantises, so every reading in the ecosystem is the same
 *     measurement taken the same way.
 *   - Starts the service if it is cold and waits for it. A cold start loads
 *     the pattern library (~65-100s); warm reads are ~1.5s.
 *   - Returns null when no reading could be taken. NEVER a substitute number.
 *     Absence of a reading is not a reading of zero.
 *   - Caches by content hash, so a re-read of unchanged content is free.
