/**
 * Risk-score factor table — data-driven detectors and recommendations.
 *
 * Split out from `risk-score.js` so the main scoring module can stay
 * under its own quality gate. Each entry is a self-contained detector:
 *
 *   name:           stable id
 *   detect(ctx):    returns null (skip) or { severity, message }
 *   recommend(ctx): returns a string; only called when detect matched
 *
 * The scoring module's `extractFactors()` iterates this table, runs
 * each detector against a context object, and returns a sorted list.
 *
 * Notable omission: `fractalAlignment` was in earlier drafts but the
 * Phase 1 correlation data went the WRONG direction — higher fractal
 * correlated with MORE bugs (ρ = +0.26), not fewer. Removing the
 * fractal factor avoids surfacing a claim the data does not support.
 * The raw value is still reported in `signals` for context, just not
 * as a "top risk factor" with a recommendation.
