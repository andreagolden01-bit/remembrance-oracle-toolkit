/**
 * element-growth — the periodic table's growth door.
 *
 * codex-ingest renders approved lexicon proposals into
 * src/atomic/periodic-table-additions.js as a list of registerElement({...})
 * calls, and that generated file requires the name from a sibling module.
 * The name was never defined anywhere: the first active proposal would have
 * thrown `TypeError: registerElement is not a function` at require time. It
 * stayed quiet only because the element count has been 0 since the file was
 * generated — a growth path that had never grown.
 *
 * The door lives here rather than inside periodic-table.js for two reasons
 * the gates gave, not preferences:
 *
 *   the size ratchet — periodic-table.js is a grandfathered monolith, and
 *   adding the door inline grew it past its slack. A new capability belongs
 *   in a new organ, not bolted onto the largest file that could hold it.
 *
 *   the orphan ratchet — the canonical table path had no consumer as a
 *   public export. Here it is module-internal, reached only through
 *   defaultTable(), which is what actually needs it.
 *
 * Dependency runs one way only — element-growth → periodic-table — so the
 * door adds no cycle to the graph it was born into.
