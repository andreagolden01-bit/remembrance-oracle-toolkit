/**
 * coherency-token-components — the THREE numbers a coherency token is
 * derived from, each measured through the instrument and carried with its
 * source, so the slot can never again be filled by "whatever number was at
 * hand".
 *
 * WHAT WAS WRONG (trap 51). COHERENCY_V1_SPEC named two different quantities
 * for `waveform_score` in one sentence — "top-K mean correlation against the
 * substrate library" (resonance) and compress()['avg_l1_coherence'] (the
 * compressor's byte coherency) — and both implementations took the number
 * from their caller. Measured 2026-09-06 through the surface on six real
 * inputs: with the compressor's reading in the slot, code unified at
 * 0.20–0.30 (rejection) and only a periodic series cleared the gate; with
 * whitened resonance in the slot, code unified at 0.73–0.88 and the series
 * was rejected. The gate did not decide; the slot did.
 *
 * THE SLOT, FIXED. waveform_score IS the pattern's resonance with the
 * substrate library: the mean top-K cosine of its 232-D decoder vector
 * (decoder-stack.composedAtDepth at the active depth) against the library,
 * taken in the ONE resonance space (whitening-reference.js) — the same
 * reading the goggles' META lens prints. Source label
 * `resonance:void-library:meanTopK:whitened`. The compressor's byte
 * coherency is a different quantity; it rides on every seal under its own
 * name (`void:compress_signal`) and is carried here as `coherency`, never in
 * the slot. The retired 256-D byte waveform is refused by width: a vector
 * that is not a whole number of 29-D layers, or is exactly 256 wide, cannot
 * be a decoder vector and never enters a token.
 *
 *   text_score     — src/unified/coherency.js computeCoherencyScore(code).total
 *                    (source code only; null for prose / data)
 *   waveform_score — resonance as above (every input)
 *   atomic_score   — src/atomic/property-extractor over each function's
 *                    BODY: the mean benignity the extractor computes (harm
 *                    none 1.0 / minimal 0.75 / moderate 0.5 / dangerous 0.0;
 *                    0.0 where computed alignment is degrading or intention
 *                    malevolent). Shape, never declarations (code only)
 *
 * unified = geometric mean over the non-null components (coherency-v1.js).
