/**
 * @oracle-infrastructure — substrate-native defect detection; internal,
 * not user-input-driven.
 *
 * defect-resonance — META-DEBUG's language-agnostic channel.
 *
 * The classical audit checkers (audit/ast-checkers) are parse-based and
 * therefore JS/TS-bound. This channel is the substrate-native
 * counterpart: a DEFECT IS A SHAPE. Known-bad code, encoded through the
 * same 5-layer composed encoder as everything else, becomes a defect
 * signature in the same coordinate system the whole substrate lives in.
 * A block of code — in ANY language — that resonates with a defect
 * signature at every depth is a finding.
 *
 * The library grows two ways:
 *   - SEEDS: a small multi-language set of classic defect shapes
 *     (injection, SQL-by-concat, off-by-one, swallowed errors, panic
 *     chains), shipped below.
 *   - TAUGHT: every HIGH finding the AST checkers produce on JS/TS
 *     teaches the library (the offending block is encoded and stored),
 *     so parser precision where we have it continuously sharpens the
 *     shape channel everywhere — cross-language transfer through form.
 *
 * Learning: detections flow through the same goggles-learning loop as
 * AST findings (fixed → reinforced, dismissed → decays and
 * self-suppresses), and every detection contributes to the field.
 *
 * Honest calibration note: shape-resonance trades the parser's
 * precision for universality. The gate is deliberately high
 * (DEFAULT_THRESHOLD on the full composed flow, min across depths) —
 * it will miss subtle variants rather than spray false positives; the
 * teaching loop closes the recall gap over time.
