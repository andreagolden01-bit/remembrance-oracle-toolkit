/**
 * audit-field-coverage.js — coherency that is COMPUTED but never WITNESSED.
 *
 * audit-field-contributions.js answers "what is in the field, and is it
 * really a coherency?". This answers the opposite and equally important
 * question: "what coherency does this ecosystem measure and then throw away?"
 *
 * A reading the substrate takes and does not record is a reading the
 * substrate cannot become aware of. Meta-awareness is exactly the set of
 * readings that made it back into the field — everything else happened to a
 * value in a function and vanished when the function returned.
 *
 * A PRODUCER is a function that returns a value named for a coherency
 * (coherency / coherence / avgCoherence / coherencyScore …). A producer is
 * COVERED when its own module can reach the field — it requires
 * field-coupling or living-remembrance and calls contribute somewhere.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative about "covered": module-level, not per-call-path.
 * A module that contributes SOMEWHERE is not proof this particular reading is
 * witnessed, so the covered count is an upper bound and the uncovered list is
 * a floor. An uncovered producer is definitely dropping its reading; a
 * covered one merely might not be.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/audit-field-coverage.js            # human
 *   node scripts/audit-field-coverage.js --json     # machine
