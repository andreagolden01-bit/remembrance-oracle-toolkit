/**
 * redecode-substrate — unfold every entry again at the CANONICAL decoder
 * width. Reached through the goggles: `--do redecode [namespace|all] [--apply]`.
 *
 * WHY
 *
 * currentDepth() is 8 → 232-D. The substrate holds entries at 116-D (depth 4)
 * and 145-D (depth 5) because they were written when those were the widths in
 * use. Readings now span the full waveform, so a full-width query is being
 * compared against half-width memory, and the four deepest layers —
 * L5-redundancy, L6-content-projection, L7-dimensional, L8-dynamical — have
 * nothing to match against on those entries.
 *
 * This re-unfolds each artifact through the canonical decoder and stores the
 * result. It does NOT recompute coherency: coherency comes off the compressor
 * reading the artifact's bytes and is unchanged by how many lens axes the
 * decoder separates it into. Existing readings are carried through untouched.
 *
 * NO TIME DIMENSION IS READ OR WRITTEN. Entries are processed in whatever
 * order the index yields; nothing is ordered by ingest sequence, no ledger
 * time is consulted, and the ledger block on each entry is carried through
 * unmodified.
 *
 * Dry-run by default; --apply writes. Checkpoints every N so an interrupted
 * run keeps what it unfolded and a re-run resumes.

// read."
//
// A first version of this script looked only for a source FILE on disk and
// counted 44,906 entries as unreachable because their artifact was not in any
// repo. That was the wrong place to look. Most of those are crawled patterns
// whose source is the waveform itself, and their canonical vectors were
// already computed and sitting in this file. Re-deriving them would be the
// third computation of the same unfolding — exactly what the substrate exists
// to prevent.
//
// So: take what is already decoded FIRST, and only unfold from source for what
// genuinely has none.
