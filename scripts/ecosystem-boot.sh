# ecosystem-boot.sh — bring the WHOLE instrument up in one container.
#
# The field-server image (Dockerfile.field-server) ships the hub alone, so
# the deployed goggles could not reach the repos the instrument is made of:
# no Void compressor (every coherency fell back to the corpus read), no
# chain (nothing witnessed), no mirrors. This boot closes that: the one
# surface on the deploy is the same one surface as everywhere else.
#
#   1. Clone (or fast-forward) every ecosystem repo as siblings under
#      $ECOSYSTEM_HOME — shallow, the layout every module resolves against
#      (store-path.js, void-service.js VOID_ROOT, chain lookups).
#   2. Install the substrate-fractal wheel Void ships in dist/ (the fast
#      path; the service degrades to the slow path without it and says so).
#   3. Start the Void compressor service through its ONE controller
#      (scripts/service-ctl.py — no second spawner, per the trap ledger).
#   4. exec the field server from the hub — the MCP/HTTP surface the
#      goggles verbs and the interface speak to.
#
# Env:
#   ECOSYSTEM_HOME   parent of all repos            (default /eco)
#   GITHUB_TOKEN     token for private clones       (optional; public without)
#   ECOSYSTEM_BRANCH branch to clone                (default: each repo's default)
#   SKIP_VOID=1      skip wheel + service           (field-server-only mode)
#   SKIP_CLONE=1     trust the repos already there  (baked or mounted)
#   BOOT_VOID_ONLY=1 wheel + service, then exit     (setup-ecosystem.sh's
#                    instrument stage — ONE implementation of these steps,
#                    the installer reuses the boot rather than carrying a
#                    second copy that drifts)
#
# Fails loud, never half-up: a repo that cannot clone is named and the boot
# stops — a surface missing its instrument must not come up looking whole.
