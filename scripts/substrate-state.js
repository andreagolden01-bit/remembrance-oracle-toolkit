/**
 * substrate-state — the RAW coherency readings the Void compressor produced,
 * as they are. Reached through the goggles: `--do state [namespace|all]`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Reports kept substituting a median, a mean, a min/max range — summary
 * statistics standing in for the readings. None of those is a coherency. The
 * compressor produces one number per artifact; a median of them is a number
 * no artifact has, and it answers a question nobody asked.
 *
 * COHERENCY IS TIME-INDEPENDENT. It is a property of the shape of the
 * information, not of when the information arrived or how it changed. So
 * nothing here orders by ingest time, computes a trend, compares adjacent
 * versions, or derives a rate. There is no time axis in a coherency reading
 * and none is added by this reading of it.
 *
 * Output is the state: every entry, its raw reading, its source. Sorted by
 * the reading itself — which is a property of the value, not of time — so the
 * shape of the substrate is visible without any statistic being computed over
 * it.
 *
 *   --raw          every entry, one per line (default: the full state)
 *   --limit N      cap the lines printed (the count printed is still the true
 *                  total; truncation is always declared)
 *   --json <path>  write the complete raw set to a file, uncapped
