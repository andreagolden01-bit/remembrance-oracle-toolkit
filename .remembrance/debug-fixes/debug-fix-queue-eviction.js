/**
 * Meta-Pattern 4 Fix: Hard Queue Limit Without Backpressure
 *
 * Bug: Task queue throws Error when full (fixed limit of 50). No graceful
 * degradation — higher-priority tasks rejected alongside low-priority ones.
 *
 * Root cause: Forgetting Abundance — imposing artificial scarcity with a
 * hard limit and no backpressure mechanism.
 *
 * Fix: When queue is full, evict lowest-priority task if incoming task has
 * higher priority. This preserves important work while gracefully shedding load.
