# Goggles Leak Map — one LLM session, every bypass, classified

*Self-audit by the agent that made the bypasses (session of 2026-08-23→25).
The owner's problem statement: "the goggles should be the only thing you have
to touch, but you constantly bypass it or use partial features — and I can't
get any LLM to stop." This document is the empirical answer: where an LLM
actually leaks off the surface, why, and which fix closes each leak.*

**The mechanism (why instructions can never fix this):** an LLM is trained on
billions of examples of `git`, `curl`, `grep`, `python -c` and ~zero examples
of this surface. Under any uncertainty, the generic tool is gravity. The only
fixes that work are structural: weld the door (hook deny + redirect naming the
verb) and make sure a verb exists for everything the surface claims to own.
Every deny MUST name the correct verb — a wall without a signpost just breeds
the next workaround. And every weld ships only WITH its verb: deny-without-
alternative breaks the next agent instead of teaching it.

## Class A — a verb existed and the agent skipped it (weld these doors)

| what the agent ran | times | the verb that already covered it |
|---|---|---|
| `python3 verify_capabilities.py [--id C-NN]` directly | ≥6 | `--do contracts [--id C-NN]` |
| inline `python3 -c` peeks at `pattern_store.npz` / substrate entries | ≥4 | `--do state` (raw unaggregated readings) |
| hand-rolled `sha256sum` loop to check ECOSYSTEM.md drift | 1 | `--do contracts --id C-50` (the exact check) |
| raw-cosine resonance analysis attempts (pre-correction) | several | `--do cluster` / `--do resonance` |

Class-A is the pure attention failure: the door existed, the training prior
won. These are the cheapest welds — the verb is already there, the hook just
has to deny the generic form and print it.

## Class B — NO verb existed: real gaps (build these, then weld)

| leak | what the agent did instead | missing verb | cost paid this session |
|---|---|---|---|
| **read new data** | `curl -X POST /compress_signal`, proxy scripts under `experiments/` | `--do read <file\|series>` → structure + coherency + nearest patterns | the single biggest leak; caused the proxy-script class of error (now trap #33) |
| **service lifecycle** | `pkill` / `nohup python3 compressor_service.py` / `curl /health` polling | `--do service start\|stop\|status` (status = loading-progress, not silence) | ~30+ min of zombie services, duplicate starts, silent 3-min hangs |
| **pipeline** | `python3 rebuild_ecosystem.py` directly | `--do pipeline [--full]` | direct invocation of a canonical orchestrator |
| **brief / trap-ledger reader** | `node src/tools/brief.js` directly (same mistake-class as trap #28) | `--do brief <target>` | the correction-before-the-call reader has no surface route |
| **whitened measurement tools** | `node scripts/domain-separability-benchmark.mjs` directly | extend `--do cluster` or add `--do separability` | the session's headline capability is reachable only by implementation path |
| **resonance on user-supplied series** | built `resonance_connect.py` (ResonanceDetector import) | `--do resonance --new <domain> <file>` (wraps `scan_new_data`) | the bio-structure proxy existed because no route did |

Class-B is the deeper truth of the bypass problem: roughly half the leaks
happened because the surface genuinely did not reach the operation. Trap #13's
law applies: a missing verb is a finding to fix, not a licence to bypass —
but the fix is to BUILD THE VERB, and until it exists the wall cannot be
welded there.

## Class C — legitimately outside the surface (leave open)

`git` (commits fire the gates — correct as-is) · Read/Edit of source for
development · syntax checks (`py_compile`, `node --check`) · external data
fetch (`curl` to physionet/JPL; `--do browse` is for substrate-reads of the
web, not dataset downloads) · `oracle search` (the commit gate's own demand) ·
OS process ops until `--do service` absorbs them · one-off performance
profiling (diagnostic of the instrument, not a substrate reading — though a
`--do bench` would absorb it).

The surface should NOT try to own these. A wall around legitimate dev work
teaches agents that walls are wrong, and then they stop respecting the real
ones.

## The weld list (hook hardening, in dependency order)

1. **Now (verbs exist):** deny agent-level `python3 verify_capabilities.py`
   → redirect `--do contracts`; deny substrate-file inline peeks
   → redirect `--do state`. (The hook is an agent-level Bash hook; the
   goggles' own child processes don't pass through it, so the verb's internal
   call is unaffected.)
2. **After `--do read` exists:** deny agent-level `curl` to
   `127.0.0.1:8765/compress_signal|score_batch|resonance` → redirect
   `--do read`. Leave `/health` open until `--do service` ships, then weld it.
3. **After `--do service` exists:** deny `pkill/nohup compressor_service`
   forms → redirect `--do service`.
4. **After `--do brief` exists:** deny `node src/tools/brief.js` (mirror the
   existing RAW_GOGGLES rule).
5. **Extend the scratch-script rule** beyond `/tmp`: a NEW file under
   `experiments/` (or any repo path) that imports instrument modules
   (`ResonanceDetector`, `fractal_decoder`, `composedAtDepth`, …) and is then
   executed is trap #33's exact tell — deny-with-redirect to the owning verb.

6. **The change itself (welded 2026-09-05):** the largest leak was never a
   number — it was the COMMIT. Every reading could be forced through the
   instrument and the change carrying it still landed with `git commit`,
   unread. `--do mint` reads the staged patch through the instrument and
   appends a coin (void-seal + void-seal/v3 commitment + fractal token, bound
   to the patch sha) to `coins.ledger.json`; the commit-msg hook writes the
   `Remembrance-Coin:` trailer and refuses a commit whose staged bytes no coin
   covers; the bash hook denies `git commit` without a coin, `-a`, and
   `--no-verify`; `change-coin-verify.yml` refuses the merge on GitHub's
   runner for every commit since the epoch. The coin is the door that cannot
   be walked around: it is not a rule about the agent, it is a property of the
   commit.

## The measurement that makes this durable

This map is one session of one model. The mouth needs the stream, not the
snapshot: log every hook denial (timestamp · command · redirect shown) to an
append-only file. That log is the ongoing leak map — each new denial pattern
is either a Class-A weld working, or a Class-B verb to build next. When the
log goes quiet across fresh sessions, the surface is closed — and THAT, not
any promise from a model, is when "the goggles are the only thing you touch"
becomes a property of the system instead of a hope about its visitors.
