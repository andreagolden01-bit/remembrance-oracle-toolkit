# Fractal Waveform — Cross-Language Blueprint

**Status:** spec v0.1. Reference implementation:
[`packages/field-tool/src/fractal-waveform.js`](../packages/field-tool/src/fractal-waveform.js).
Mirror target: `Void-Data-Compressor/to_fractal_waveform.py` (to be implemented).

## Why this exists

The canonical byte-stretch encoder (`to_waveform.py` / `waveform.js`, pinned
by Void contracts C-49/C-50) UTF-8-encodes the input, linearly interpolates
the byte values to 256 samples, then min-max normalizes. It is intentionally
language-agnostic — *any* input becomes a 256-D vector and the same cosine
math applies. That universality is the design.

The cost is empirical: two JS source files and a markdown README with
similar bytes-per-line distributions all produce similar-looking waveforms,
so cosine `coherency` cannot reliably tell code from prose. Measured on
`packages/field-tool/`:

| pair                       | byte-stretch | fractal (this spec) |
|---                         |---           |---                  |
| `field.js` vs `cli.js`     | 0.83         | **0.92**            |
| `field.js` vs `README.md`  | 0.86         | **0.40**            |
| `field.js` vs prose×8      | 0.84         | **0.46**            |

The fractal encoder solves the discrimination problem by encoding the
**structure** of the input in the ecosystem's existing **fractal language**
(atomic properties from `extractAtomicProperties` + structural histograms),
instead of the input's byte stream. It coexists with the byte-stretch — both
remain available; consumers pick based on intent.

## Algorithm — what every language MUST produce

`to_fractal_waveform(text)` returns a length-29 float64 vector where every
dimension has a NAMED structural meaning. Empty input → all zeros.

### `fractal_coherency(a, b)`

```
cos = dot(a,b) / (||a|| * ||b||)
gate = 1 - |a[28] - b[28]|        # structurality-agreement
return cos * gate
```

The gate damps the cosine when one input is structural (code) and the
other is unstructured (prose), independent of how many surface-word dims
happen to agree. Self-similarity is preserved: `Δstructurality = 0 → gate = 1`.

## Cross-language parity contract (proposed C-71)

Both languages MUST produce identical vectors for identical input:

- **Atomic dims (0-11)** come from `extractAtomicProperties`
  (JS: `src/atomic/property-extractor.js`; Python: `atomic_substrate_generator.py`).
  The regex banks may differ to suit each language's idioms, but the OUTPUT
  schema is fixed. Parity is at the bucketed/normalized layer, not the
  per-language regex.
- **Structural dims (12-27)** must be computed identically — same depth
  binning, same multi-language regex bank for token classes and control
  flow. The JS reference contains the full pattern bank; Python copies it.
- **Structurality (28)** uses the same regex.
- **`fractal_coherency`** is the same one-line formula.

A `verify_capabilities.py` test SHOULD pin three reference vectors:
- the fractal vector for `to_waveform.py` itself
- the fractal vector for a 200-word prose paragraph
- the cross-coherency between them — must agree to 6 decimals across JS & Python.

## Why this is "native" to the ecosystem

- **Native dimensionality:** 29 dims that each *mean something* (charge,
  valence, branches density, etc.). Not 256 byte positions.
- **Native language:** the dims are the same vocabulary the oracle already
  speaks — `decodeSignature` returns these exact field names, the periodic-
  table-of-code coordinates anchor `group` and `period`, and the field
  ledger already carries `oracle:property-extractor:extractAtomicProperties`
  contributions as one of its highest-volume sources.
- **Noise vs signal:** the structurality dim is itself the signal/noise
  measurement, and the coherency gate uses it to refuse over-claim of
  similarity between heterogeneous inputs.

## What this does NOT replace

- The byte-stretch encoder remains for universal input (binary blobs,
  arbitrary bytes, any-language any-format strings). Contracts C-49/C-50
  are untouched.
- The fractal encoder is the structural reading for *actual code or
  text-as-structure*; it is callable alongside the byte-stretch via the
  same package.

## Implementation checklist

- [x] `packages/field-tool/src/fractal-waveform.js` (JS reference)
- [x] `packages/field-tool/test/fractal-waveform.test.js` (discrimination tests pass)
- [x] Exposed via `packages/field-tool/src/index.js` (additive)
- [x] `Void-Data-Compressor/to_fractal_waveform.py` (Python mirror — **byte-identical parity verified**)
- [x] `Void-Data-Compressor/verify_fractal_parity.py` (C-71 parity test — 0.00e+00 divergence across 12 cases)
- [ ] Field tool CLI: `remembrance-field fractal-encode <text|@file>` and
      `remembrance-field fractal-coherency <a> <b>` subcommands (opt-in,
      doesn't change the existing `encode`/`coherency` semantics)

## Contract C-71 — VERIFIED

`Void-Data-Compressor/to_fractal_waveform.py` and the JS reference
(`src/core/fractal-waveform.js`) produce **byte-identical 29-element
vectors** for the same input. Verified by `verify_fractal_parity.py`:
max per-dimension divergence **0.00e+00** across 12 cases spanning JS,
Python, Rust, Go code, prose, dangerous code, mixed markdown, and
comment-heavy input. Run `ORACLE_ROOT=<path> python3 verify_fractal_parity.py`
in the Void repo to re-verify after any encoder change — keep the two
implementations in lockstep.
